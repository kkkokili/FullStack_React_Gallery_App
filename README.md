#### Project Overview
The React gallery app is an image gallery app built in a modular fashion to display 24 images
in a page using Axios to fetch data from the Flickr API. <br />
The gallery app has a search component to display searched images, and the searched text is added to the route. <br />
There are 3 default displayed topics that are already setup using React Router.

#### In the project directory, you can run:
- `npm install` to install all the necessary dependencies
- Then, you will need to create a `.env` in the `src` directory of the project
- In the `.env` file, you need to add a flickr api key.
- Use this format to add the api key in the `.env` file.
```
 REACT_APP_API_KEY = ''
```
- To start the project `npm start`
- To build for production `npm run build`. 
- Consequently, you can access these actions of starting and building the project in the `package.json`.
